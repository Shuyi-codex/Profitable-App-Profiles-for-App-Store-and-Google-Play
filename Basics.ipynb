    "# Profitable Apps Profiles to Develop for Google Play and App Store Markets\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we try to find out app profiles which are beneficial for iOS and Android develops in their respective markets. We are working as data analyst for a company that develops both Android and iOS apps. This project is therefore focused on helping  the company make informed decisions about profitable apps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the company is in the business of developing free applications for both Google Play and App Store, revenue for these apps is therefore generated from in-app ads. This in turn depends on the number of downloads and number of users that interact with those in-app ads. Our main goal is therefore to analyse current data on download activities on both Google Play and App Store in order to know which app profiles are likely to attract more users and are profitable for the company to develop.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two data sets that seem suitable for our goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * A data set containing data about approximately 10,000 Android apps from Google Play; the data was collected in August 2018. The data set was downloaded directly from this [link](https://dq-content.s3.amazonaws.com/350/googleplaystore.csv).\n",
    "   * A data set containing data about approximately 7,000 iOS apps from the App Store; the data was collected in July 2017. The data set was downloaded directly from this [link](https://dq-content.s3.amazonaws.com/350/AppleStore.csv).\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "We'll start by opening and exploring these two data sets. To make them easier to explore, we created a function named `explore_data()` that can be used to repeatedly print rows in a readable way."

    "### App Profiles Recommendation for App Store\n",
    "Based on the information obtained so far i.e.:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Games category dominates App Store with 58%\n",
    "   * Navigation is the most popular genre on App Store followed by Reference, Social Networking, Music and Weather respectively\n",
    "\n",
    "we can make App Profile recommendations for our company to develop. Two ideas behind our recommendations will be that lots of people are installing the apps and that people are spending a lot of time on the apps in order to interact with the in-app ads which is the source of revenue for our company.\n",
    "\n",
    "Navigation apps, although being the most popular genre on App Store, cannot be recommended. This is because apps in Navigation categorys (mainly maps, GPS) are not games and people don't spend enough time on such apps. In-app ads may not be suitable for such apps which users run mostly in the background or apps such as *Speedometer*. Such apps are made to ensure safe driving and in-apps may be a distraction. Also users may not have time to interact with in-app ads on such apps. Also, getting reliable live weather data may require us to connect our apps to non-free APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "A notable genre for consideration is the Reference genre which comes second in the most popular app list. Book apps can be developed which can incorporate quizzes, quotes and brain teasers. This idea can lure more users and make them interact more with those apps. Since users are able to derive fun from such apps, Reference genre (incorporated with games through our company's ingenuity) is a great recommendation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionary apps embedded with word games such as Scrabble, Word Search, Riddles, Cross Word, Word Puzzles should also be a major focus for developers. Another recommendation is development of Audiobook apps which can convert sections of some popular religious books and references from texts to audio. This has a great potential to attract users and also generate revenues through in-app ads.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other popular genres such as Music, Social Networking and Food could've been recommended. However, most apps in the categories involves the delivery of service (of which our company is not into) and a very large revenue. Therefore, such app profiles are not a good choice for our company.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Apps with Most Users by Genre on Google Play\n",
    "\n",
    "For the Google Play market, we actually have data about the number of installs, so we should be able to get a clearer picture about genre popularity. However, the install numbers don't seem precise enough — we can see that the figures are open-ended (1,000,000+, 100,000+, 5,000,000+, etc.):"
